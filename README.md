<h1>Project 2 : Palindrome Checker</h1>
<h3>Technologies Used - JavaScript, HTML & CSS</h3>
<h4>Try it out here - https://vishsig.github.io/palindrome-checker/</h4>
<p>This project involved the creation of an interactive web application designed to verify if a userâ€™s input is a palindrome. The application was developed using JavaScript for the core functionality, HTML for the structural framework, and CSS for the visual design.

The application is designed to be user-friendly, accepting input from the user, sanitizing it by removing all non-alphanumeric characters, and then performing a palindrome check. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

The core of the application is a palindrome checking algorithm implemented in JavaScript. This algorithm takes a string as input, sanitizes it by removing non-alphanumeric characters, converts it to lowercase, and then checks if it reads the same forward and backward.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of algorithmic thinking, user interface design, and the creation of dynamic, interactive web applications.</p>

<h1>Project 3 : Roman Numeral Converter</h1>
<h3>Technologies Used - JavaScript, HTML & CSS</h3>
<h4>Try it out here - https://vishsig.github.io/roman-numeral-converter/</h4>
<p>This project involved the development of an interactive web application designed to convert decimal numbers into their corresponding Roman numerals. The application was built using a combination of JavaScript for core functionality, HTML for structural design, and CSS for aesthetic styling.

The application is user-centric, accepting numerical input from the user and returning the equivalent Roman numeral. It incorporates robust error handling, providing warnings for inputs that are less than 1 or greater than 4000, as these are outside the range of numbers that can be represented by Roman numerals.

The core of the application is a conversion algorithm implemented in JavaScript. This algorithm takes a decimal number as input and iteratively converts it into a Roman numeral by subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral value and appending the corresponding symbol to the output string.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of algorithmic thinking, user interface design, and the creation of dynamic, interactive web applications</p>

<h1>Project 4 : Weather Information Web Application</h1>
<h3>Technologies Used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS</h3>
<h4>Try it out here - https://vishsig.github.io/Weather-App/</h4>

<p>This project involved the development of a dynamic web application designed to provide real-time weather information for any given city. The application was built using a robust tech stack including JavaScript for functionality, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling.

The application leverages the power of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, utilizing async/await syntax to handle API requests and responses. This ensures a smooth user experience by allowing the application to continue running other tasks while waiting for the API response.

The data for the application is sourced from the OpenWeather API, a powerful tool that provides a wide range of weather data. The application makes API calls to fetch data such as the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a dynamic icon representing the current weather conditions.

The integration of the OpenWeather API not only powers the core functionality of the application but also ensures the reliability and accuracy of the weather information provided. The application is designed to dynamically update the displayed information based on the data received from the API, providing users with the most current weather conditions for their chosen city.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of API integration, asynchronous programming in JavaScript, and the creation of dynamic, user-friendly web applications.</p>
